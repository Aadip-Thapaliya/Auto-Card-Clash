# Auto-Card-Clash
Ultimate Card Clash is a two-player card game where each player starts with 26 cards drawn from a deck of 52 cards. In each round, both players draw 3 random cards, and the player with the higher total card value wins the round. The winner takes the opponentâ€™s cards, and the game continues until one player runs out of cards.
